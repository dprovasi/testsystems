## Notes on G protein PTMs

#### PTMs sites on Gi
According to [Villaseca et al. 2022](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2022.941870/full),  G$\alpha$i 
"membrane location is mediated by *two* lipid modification, myristoylation and palmitoylation at the amino terminus. 
*Gαi family is the only family that is myristoylated*, in contrast with the other Gα (Gαs, Gα12/13, and Gαq) 
families that are only palmitoylated; both lipid modifications are important to allow interaction with the membrane, 
in order to interact with their receptor and with their membrane effectors

#### PTMs sites on Gi

*  [Morales et al., 1998](https://www.molbiolcell.org/doi/10.1091/mbc.9.1.1) reports that the double lipidation is established for all members of the αi family (αi1, αi2, αi3, αz, and αo) (myristoylated on the N-terminal glycine residue and palmitoylated on the adjacent cysteine).

* [Wedegaertner et al. 1995](https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258(18)83027-7/fulltext) is also in agreement with the double lipidation, and indicates the sites. Gi should be N-myristoylation at G and palmitoylated at the C ("[...] attached through a labile, reversible thioester linkage to a cysteine near the N terminus")

* [Wedegaertner et al. 1995](https://www.jbc.org/article/S0021-9258(18)83027-7/fulltext) also states that ''Myristoylation, or more specifically N-myristoylation, is the result of co-translational addition of the saturated 14-carbon fatty acid myristate to a glycine residue at the extreme N terminus *after removal of the initiating methionine*''. This is also reiterated in [Vögler et al. 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005273608001107) "The absolute requirement for a free glycine residue at the N-terminus of the substrate protein *implies that the initiating methionine must be eliminated* by a methionyl amino peptidase prior to lipidation."

#### Gi palmitoylation is reversible, and myristoylation is a precondition for Gi palmitoylation

''The *reversible nature of palmitoylation* is intriguing in this regard,  as it lends itself to a regulation integrated with the activation state of the G protein.'' ([Chen and Manning, 2001](https://www.nature.com/articles/1204185))

*  [Villaseca et al. 2022](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2022.941870/full) It quickly became evident that, for α subunits of the Gi family, N-myristoylation was a prerequisite to palmitoylation (Mumby et al., 1994; Hallak et al., 1994a; Galbiati et al., 1994), 
and that the palmitoyl moiety alone (and certainly in conjunction with the N-myristoyl moiety), 
was sufficient for attachment of at least peptides to membrane (Shahinian and Silvius, 1995).

* [Vögler et al. 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005273608001107) For the Gi family myristoylation is a precondition for palmitoylation [32], [48], the secondary lipid modification found on Gα subunits. In this context, the role of the myristoyl group is to facilitate an initial contact with the membrane and to direct the Gα subunit to the palmitoylation compartment.
