# general considerations

- an ideal bioinformatics course should contain the basic 'traditional' algorithms, along with new AI-based ones. AI-based algorithms are cool and modern and would drive the interest of students, who are likely also interested in opportunities outside academia 
- it should be hands-on, providing the students with code to build on for their studies; 
- it should put them in the condition to be able to modify the code and understand it
- consider the language problem: should the course focus on R or python, or be code agnostic?

# Texts

It's hard to find a "modern" text that includes AI-based algrithms;
moreover, presenting AI tools would require a general introduction to machine learning tools
