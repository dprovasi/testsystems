notes from [Valentino & Volkow, 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-018-0225-3)

### Endogenous ligands
Three opioid peptide **systems** encoded by individual genes for pre-proenkephalin, pre-proopiomelanocortin, and pre-prodynorphin. These have distinct brain distributions (see refs. 6-12 in the paper)

### Receptors
Three distinct receptors were cloned, μ (MOR), κ (KOR), and δ (DOR), with different selectivities for the individual endogenous peptides and for the various opiate drugs used pharmacologically.

Opioid receptor localization show similar distinct but overlapping distributions for the three receptors 
* an in situ hybridization studies (Mansour et al. )
* via localization of fluorescently tagged receptors in genetically modified mice
