## Notes on G protein PTMs


### G$\alpha$i

According to [Villaseca et al. 2022](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2022.941870/full),  G$\alpha$i 
"membrane location is mediated by *two* lipid modification, myristoylation and palmitoylation at the amino terminus. 
*Gαi family is the only family that is myristoylated*, in contrast with the other Gα (Gαs, Gα12/13, and Gαq) 
families that are only palmitoylated; both lipid modifications are important to allow interaction with the membrane, 
in order to interact with their receptor and with their membrane effectors 
(; Morales et al., 1998; Fishburn et al., 1999).

#### G$\alpha$i 

It quickly became evident that, for α subunits of the Gi family, 
N-myristoylation was a prerequisite to palmitoylation 
(Mumby et al., 1994; Hallak et al., 1994a; Galbiati et al., 1994), 
and that the palmitoyl moiety alone (and certainly in conjunction with the N-myristoyl moiety), 
was sufficient for attachment of at least peptides to membrane (Shahinian and Silvius, 1995).

#### reversibility of 
''The reversible nature of palmitoylation is intriguing in this regard, 
as it lends itself to a regulation integrated with the activation state of the G protein.'' ([Chen and Manning, 2001](https://www.nature.com/articles/1204185))


Myristoylation has been also found important for palmitoylation of Gαi (Dunphy et al., 1996).
