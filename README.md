## pxylene-charmm36-gmx
This is a test system for yank repex explicit solvent simulation from gromacs topologies with charmm36 parameters and 
ligand topology from paramchem. System coordinates are from yank [p-xylene example](https://github.com/choderalab/yank/blame/master/examples/p-xylene-explicit/setup/setup.sh)

## GPCR-aa
An all-atom example, setting up a simulation for yank testing

## GPCR-is 
A GPCR implicit solvent example, setting up a simulation for yank testing
